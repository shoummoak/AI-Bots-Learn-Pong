# AI-Bots-Learn-Pong
AI Bots learn to play a game similar to Atari Pong. The bots are powered by Artificial Neural Networks. The objective is to keep the ball from falling. They learn to play the game by playing the game X number of times. They fail until a few of the bots eventually figure out how to play the game forever.
